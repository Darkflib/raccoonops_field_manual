# Tools of the Trade

> "Simple and composable..."

RaccoonOps is built on the principle of using simple and composable tools that enhance our productivity and collaboration. We believe in leveraging both open-source and commercial tools that align with our values and operational needs. Our toolkit is designed to be flexible, allowing us to adapt to changing requirements while maintaining efficiency and effectiveness in our workflows.

Why not 100% open-source? While we strive to use open-source tools whenever possible, we also recognize the value that commercial tools can bring in terms of support, features, and integration. Our goal is to find the right balance that meets our needs and supports our mission. Your balance may vary, and we encourage you to choose tools that work best for your team and projects. If you find a tool that fits your needs, go for it! The key is to ensure that the tools you use are simple, composable, and enhance your team's productivity.
